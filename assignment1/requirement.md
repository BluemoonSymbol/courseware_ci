designing a genetic algorithm to solve the first problem, you should do:

1: clearly pointintg out the following steps in the implementations:
  1) initialization
  2) fitness evaluation
  3) selection for crossover and mutation
  4) environmental selection
  
2: please set the following components based on your own preferences:
  1) the probabilities of crossover, mutation, elitsm
  2) the size of population, the types of crossover and mutation
  3) and etc.
  
3: please independently run the algorithms at least 30 times, and report finally report the mean and std values.

4: please draw the evolutionary process uysing the data from any run

5: please draw the mean, max, and min values of each run
